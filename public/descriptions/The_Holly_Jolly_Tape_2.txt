Full disclosure, this is essentially the same concept as the first one, but without the stress of finals week. I find some holiday songs, and then sample them. This volume of The Holly Jolly Tapes now features the stress of ✨adulting✨.

The big difference is that all of the samples (except for the Tik Toks and movie quotes) came from vinyl. I literally had never sampled from vinyl before this project. Honestly, it's more fun this way. I felt like Metro Boomin in that Million Dollaz Worth of Game interview. The first half is very uptempo and sounds more like "Zae's Room", the second half is more chill and relies more on the samples. All of it is supposed to make you feel like you're in the crib with your family in matching pajamas, drinking hot chocholate and putting up decorations for what ever holiday you celebrate in the wintertime. With that being said, happy holidays!
