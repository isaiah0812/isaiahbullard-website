If Maestro was the introduction, Zae's Room is the first chapter. This is the story of one's own goals and ambitions--told through many different lenses--but ultimately, this is my story. Every detail of this story is in my own head, but it can be echoed through others. This is what I sought out to do in Zae's Room. This album is the first attempt at a fully collaborative, "compilation-style" album. However, instead of merely making a bunch of beats and picking some random artists to collaborate on them, I worked with the artists featured, and made sure they understood the story that was being told throughout this project. Each track has a purpose in the overall story, but the interesting scenarios given to the artists to write about are what makes this project so special. Whether it's imagining you're opening for a circus with a freestyle, or taking a magic carpet ride with a girl who's wasting your time--Zae's Room's concepts are, admittedly, weird. But, these concepts allow the listener to go deeper into my mind. They allow for the listener to understand that no one truly thinks the same about certain situations. In this case, I don't see my own passions and ambitions in the same way that anybody else sees them, and that's a lesson I've learned. However, another lesson I've learned is when you have a dream, you chase it at all costs. That's what Zae's Room is. I'm merely telling the world about the dreams I'm chasing.

"Zae's Room" is dedicated to my brother, Isaac, who inspires me to chase my dreams, regardless of the way that the world looks at me, and to my friend, Bella, who got me to write the last verse.
