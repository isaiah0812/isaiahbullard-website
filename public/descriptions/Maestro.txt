No matter what you do, you can't escape where you're from; you can't escape how you're raised. It makes you who you are, whether you like that person or not. However you see home, that's how you choose to see it, therefore becoming the master of your own world and your own story.

The Maestro.

This album explores that concept. More specifically, this album explores all of the parts that make up who I am. The album is instrumental, and each instrumental represents someone or something in my life that makes me who I am. Each instrumental tells represents how I view its subject and the particular personality trait of mine that it has brought out in myself. Whether that be my value for brotherhood, my love for music itself, or my constant hope regardless of the circumstance, each track has it's own meaning to me. However, the fact that there are no words in a majority of the album allows for it to be consumed by all audiences, and for each track to mean something different for each listener. The album tells a differnet story of oneself, regardless of how one was raised or one's home.

The album definitely has a classical feel, and that is intentional, as I've always intended to convert the album into a modern Symphony at some point. The goal for the mix was to make it sound like it's coming from a stage, however it's rough enough to convey the fact that no home is perfect. As much as I'd like to give praise to my home for breeding the greatness that is the man that types this description, it's not that. To be frank, it can suck sometimes. However, the constant use of bright instruments, even in the darker portions of the project, show that that there's always light in the dark with this project. The remastered version of the project, released on the one-year anniversary of the project in 2019, does feature a cleaner mix, but overall, it still remains a bit rough to capture that imperection of any home.
