    "description": "Since 2017, I have been a self-taught music producer, songwriter, composer, and mixing engineer. Raised in Pflugerville, Texas, my influences come from genres such as hip-hop, R&B, classical, jazz, rock, and gospel. My passion for music started at a young age with the drumset and the piano. That same passion is now seen in music production alongside a newfound passion for the art of music with the world.",
